                  Estate Management is art and science of supervising the use,
                  development and management of landed property, other natural
                  resources and the built environment. The estate management
                  programme is intended to prepare students to appreciate the
                  complexity of legal, economic, technological and social
                  impacts on the use, development and management of land and the
                  environment. The emerging world trend in technological
                  advancement and environmental concern, calls for the need to
                  design responsive programmes for the training of future
                  graduates in Estate Management. The degree envisaged is B. Sc.
                  Estate Management and Valuation. It has taken the University
                  of Abuja too long a time to establish a department of Estate
                  Management and Valuation. It is therefore heart-warming that
                  in the preceding expansion programme of the University,
                  Department of Estate Management and Valuation received
                  attention. The senate of the University supported the
                  University Management proposal of the establishment of
                  Department of Estate Management and Valuation in the
                  University and 2023/2024 was approved as the commencement
                  period. The programme is structured to equip the graduates
                  with the requisite academic and practical knowledge to meet
                  the mission of the programme which is to educate and train
                  graduates for sound scientific, technical, entrepreneurial and
                  managerial skills for estate surveying and valuation practice
                  for the benefit and satisfaction of clients and the society.
                  In pursuit of this mission, courses have been drawn from other
                  disciplines such as Economics, Agriculture, Physical Sciences,
                  Accounting and Management, Computer science, Law and Social
                  Sciences as well as other disciplines in the Environmental
                  Sciences. Courses offered in the Department are categorized
                  into three, namely compulsory (C), required (R) and elective
                  (E) courses. The department has 106 units of core courses, 87
                  units of required courses and 20 units of elective courses
                  available for offering. Students are expected to take all the
                  compulsory and required courses compulsorily and take the
                  specified minimum units of elective courses. For graduation,
                  the student must have taken and passed all the compulsory and
                  required courses as well as the specified minimum 12 units of
                  electives with total credit units not less than the minimum
                  specified units for graduation in the University Academic
                  Regulation. Department of Estate Management and Valuation
                  Programme is marketable in terms of patronage and enrolment as
                  well as job opportunities for the products. The products are
                  to be functional and useful and are hopefully to be in demand
                  in national affairs as well as international services.
